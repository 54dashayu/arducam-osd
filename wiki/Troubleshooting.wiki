*MinimOSD won't connect to APM*

This is probably due to outdated firmware that does not support the current MAVLink 1.0 standard used by !ArduPlane and !ArduCopter. Upgrade your MinimOSD firmware to Version 1.9 or above, which you can find [http://code.google.com/p/arducam-osd/downloads/list here]. Firmware upgrading instructions are [http://code.google.com/p/arducam-osd/wiki/Update_Firmware here].

*Video overlay presenting fuzzy and not well formed chars*

Defective and fuzzy chars are the result of a faulty character updating.
Max7456's internal memory is really picky about voltage level during a charset update. Usually it happens with some PCs with lower USB voltage.
The only way to fix that is updating the charset by feeding the board properly. Just making sure it has around 5V there. E.g.: tying the two stages and feeding it by a external battery on the video IO pins.
