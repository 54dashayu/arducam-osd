*MinimOSD won't connect to APM*

This is probably due to outdated firmware that does not support the current MAVLink 1.0 standard used by !ArduPlane and !ArduCopter. Upgrade your MinimOSD firmware to Version 1.9 or above, which you can find [http://code.google.com/p/arducam-osd/downloads/list here]. Firmware upgrading instructions are [http://code.google.com/p/arducam-osd/wiki/Update_Firmware here].

*Video overlay presenting fuzzy and not well formed chars*

Defective and fuzzy chars are the result of a faulty character updating.
Max7456's internal memory is really picky about voltage level during a charset update. Usually it happens with some PCs with lower USB voltage.
The only way to fix that is updating the charset by feeding the board properly. Just making sure it has around 5V there. E.g.: tying the two stages and feeding it by a external battery on the video IO pins.

*Data is showing up only when MinimOSD's TX connected to APM's RX*

This isn't a problem with the firmware. Your APM isn't sending the data automatically. So, because of that you need to request data rates from APM by using the Mission Planer, another GCS or even by your OSD board. That's why it just works with TX connected. ArduPlane saves the requested rates on EEPROM (last request from a GCS or OSD). ArduCopter doesn't do that.
E,g. Check on Mission Planner: Configuration >> Parameter List:
All the params with the prefix "SR3_" are related to this. E.g.: SR3_Extra1 = 5 means the IMU data being sent through telem port (serial 3) five times per second. If that wasn't set, so it will not send IMU data without a explicit requesting.
