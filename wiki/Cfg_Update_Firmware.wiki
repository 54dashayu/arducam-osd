= Updating MinimOSD Firmware =

If you just want to update your OSD board, the easiest way is using released .hex files from our [http://code.google.com/p/arducam-osd/downloads/list Download Section] and use our configuration tool as explained below.

*Important NOTE:*<br>After updating your OSD to the firmware 2.0 or above you need to keep your Config Tool updated.<br> This will update your EEPROM for new resorces automatically. You just need to connect the board to the new OSD config.
<br>So, is *mandatory* to install the *newest "ArduCAM OSD Config Tool"* and also update the Character Set.<br> A new charset is available on the Config Tool's install folder. From now on it will be always there as *"OSD_Charset.mcm"*.


== Using ArduCAM Config Tool ==

  # Connect your FTDI Serial adapter ([https://store.diydrones.com/FTDI_Cable_3_3V_p/ttl-232r-3v3.htm Like this one]) to the six-pin connector.
  # Select the proper Serial COM Port (on the example bellow is COM12. Your adapter may use another one);
  # Go to menu *Options* and select *Update Firmware*.
  # Select the desired .hex file (you can download the latest one [http://code.google.com/p/arducam-osd/downloads/list here]) from your PC and press *Open*;

When the process starts, you board will reboot and go to the upload process in few seconds.<br>
If there is a video monitor attached to the OSD, the screen will turn to a blank state.<br>
You have to observe the loading bar on the bottom of ArduCAM OSD Config screen.

== Using Arduino ==

This project is based on Arduino. So, you can download the code, make tweaks, customize or just update the firmware through Arduino IDE.<br> All you need to do is checkout the source from our [http://code.google.com/p/arducam-osd/source/checkout SVN repository].
