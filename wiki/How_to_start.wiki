= How to start =

The first thing you'll need to do is checkout the trunk from ArduCam OSD source code.

== About trunk folders ==

*ArduCamOSD_Beta*

This is an Arduino project folder which have the code base to adapt/integrate with any project. Until now the OSD part is running on something like a "demo loop" just to allow us to test it and seeing some values changing, simulating as it came from APM

*Tools*

 * *Max_Char_Write*

This is another Arduino project folder, used to set the arduino as a bridge to upload the new charset to Max7456.
You will need a good terminal to "send file". I'm using "TeraTerm Pro". It's free, from [http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA002416/teraterm.html here].

 * *root files in Tools folder*

  * TERATERM.INI (modified to open more than default 4 serial ports)
  * OSD_SA_v3.mcm (the !ArduCam OSD charset)
  * MAX7456Charwizard.jar <--- used to see/change the charset
