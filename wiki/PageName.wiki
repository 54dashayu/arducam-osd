*Arduino 328p Board:*
  * *SeeedStudio:* http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/seeeduino-v22-atmega-328p-p-669.html?cPath=79_80&zenid=7fe38f862c182bbe21f5dce4200a1f67
  Note: mine is V2.12

  Note: this is the original one: *Cisrcuits at Home:* http://www.circuitsathome.com/products-page/arduino-shields/usb-host-shield-for-arduino/

*Breakout Board for MAX7456 On Screen Display:*

== Reduced Hardware: ==

*This will be the smallest approach (right):*

Note: It will need some adaptations for attach the Max7456 board.

== Project Goals ==

Current:
  * Mapping: commands from Canon PS (Power Shot cams) (OK);
  * Codding: to adapt essential mapped PS commands to main PTP library; (OK)
  * Codding: to wrap necessary camera resources into simple serial calls ( 90% OK);
  * Mapping: necessary registers of the chip Max7456 to work as the OSD core (OK);
  * Testing: sketch which read and write the basic Max7456 registers (OK);
  * Design:  create a basic charset to use on UAV projects (OK);
  * Codding: to insert the charset into the Max7456 prototype;
  * Codding: to wrap all the Map7456 code into a useful library;
  * Codding: to implement OSD pannels for telemetry data on screen;
  * Codding: to write a new SPI class with a parametrized CS method (chip selection);
  * Codding: to merge "USB Host" and "OSD" code using the new SPI class;
  * Codding and Hardware: to use the mini USB host shield;
  * Hardware: to develop an "all-in-one" small board.

Future:
  * Accept newest and smallest Canon PS without PTP from factory:
    * Use CHDK to open one parametrized PTP command to run internal LUA scripts;
  * Accept cams with other brands (when possible to hack their firmware).
