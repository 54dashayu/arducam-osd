= Update MAX7456 Character Set =

The !ArduCam OSD base code has an optimized way to draw panels fast on screen. This is possible due a special technique to write panels with reduced number of SPI transactions and also by the replacement of the original MAX7456 character set to a new one which is indexed as the ASCII table.


*Important Note!* You need to wire up the video-out from !ArduCam to a monitor. You will see the old character set on screen (when you start running the sketch "!Max_Char_Write") as well as the updated one, after restart the board (the last step of the updating process).



Looking at the SVN source, more specifically at the trunk, you will see the folder *[http://code.google.com/p/arducam-osd/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FTools "Tools"]*. It has all you need to update the character set.


 * *"!Max_Char_Write"*

This is an Arduino project folder, used to set the !ArduCam OSD board as a bridge to upload the new character set from your PC to the chip Max7456.

 * *Other files at the root of "Tools"*
  * *"TERATERM.INI"* (modified to open more than default 4 serial ports)
  * *"OSD_SA_v3.mcm"* (the !ArduCam OSD charset)
  * *"MAX7456Charwizard.jar"* (used to see/change the charset)

=== Character Set Editor ===

  * A double click on the file "MAX7456Charwizard.jar" runs a JAVA based application.
  * To visualize the character set file go to menu file/open and filnd the file "OSD_SA_v3.mcm".

=== Terminal ===

You will also need a good terminal software to "send file" through serial connection. I'm using "!TeraTerm Pro". It's free, from [http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA002416/teraterm.html here].

 * Install !TeraTerm;
 * Replace the ini in your program files "TTERMPRO" folder;

=== The Arduino sketch ===
 * Copy the folder !Max_Char_Write to your Arduino scketch folder;
 * Upload the sketch "!Max_Char_Write" to !ArduCam OSD board;

=== Send a new Character Set ===
 * Use !TeraTerm to send the file "OSD_SA_v1.mcm" to !ArduCam board;
 * When it finished sending it, you just need to reset Arduino. It will shows the new character set.
