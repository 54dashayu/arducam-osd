= Update MAX7456 Character Set =

On the SVN source at the trunk, the folder *[http://code.google.com/p/arducam-osd/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FTools "Tools"]* has all you need to update the character set:


 * *"!Max_Char_Write"*

This is an Arduino project folder, used to set the !ArduCam OSD board as a bridge to upload the new character set from your PC to the chip Max7456.

 * *Other files at the root of "Tools"*
  * *"TERATERM.INI"* (modified to open more than default 4 serial ports)
  * *"OSD_SA_v3.mcm"* (the !ArduCam OSD charset)
  * *"MAX7456Charwizard.jar"* (used to see/change the charset)

=== Character Set Editor ===

  * A double click on the file "MAX7456Charwizard.jar" runs a JAVA based application.
  * To visualize the character set file go to menu file/open and filnd the file "OSD_SA_v3.mcm".

=== Terminal ===

You will also need a good terminal software to "send file" through serial connection. I'm using "!TeraTerm Pro". It's free, from [http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA002416/teraterm.html here].

 * Install !TeraTerm;
 * Replace the ini in your program files "TTERMPRO" folder;

=== The Arduino sketch ===
 * Copy the folder !Max_Char_Write to your Arduino scketch folder;
 * Upload the sketch "!Max_Char_Write" to !ArduCam OSD board;

=== Send a new Character Set ===
 * Use !TeraTerm to send the file "OSD_SA_v1.mcm" to !ArduCam board;
 * When it finished sending it, you just need to reset Arduino. It will shows the new character set.
