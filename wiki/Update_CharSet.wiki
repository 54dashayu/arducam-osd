= Update MAX7456 Character Set =

The ArduCAM OSD base code has an optimized way to draw panels fast on screen. This is possible due a special technique to write panels with reduced number of SPI transactions and also by the replacement of the original MAX7456 character set to a new one which is indexed as the ASCII table.

If you got a .mcm file from our [http://code.google.com/p/arducam-osd/downloads/list Download Section] you can use our configuration tool as explained below.

== ArduCAM OSD Config (Update !CharSet) ==
  # Connect your FTDI Serial adapter ([https://store.diydrones.com/FTDI_Cable_3_3V_p/ttl-232r-3v3.htm Like this one]);
  # Select the proper Serial COM Port (on the example bellow is COM12. Your adapter may use another one);
  # Go to menu *Options* and select *Update !CharSet*.
  # Select the desired .mcm file from your PC and press *Open*;

If there is a video monitor attached to the OSD, the screen will show the bootload screen and turn to black.<br>
