Thanks to Michael Oborne, we have now an incredible customization and an the easiest setup of all ArduCAM OSD's resources.<br>
With ArduCAM OSD Config you can do all the job in just one place.<br>
Everything, from update firmware or charset to enable/disable and positioning all the panels.

== Select, Enable or Disable Panels ==
Are you looking for customization? So, Make you own layout by enabling or disabling from the panel list.

== Save and Load Layouts from File ==
We can save our favorite layouts to share with our buddies.<br>
You didn't save it? No problem. You can load direct from the board as well as save it on other one.

== Video Mode Switching and Adaptive Layout ==
ArduCAM firmware has an adaptive layout. Now you can easily check on how it will look at PAL or NTSC.
