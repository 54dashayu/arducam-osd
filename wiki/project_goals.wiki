#summary Project Status and Goals.

== Status ==

The code is NOT finished.

Even the camera control part need several changes to improve error tracking, to turn possible other PTP commands, and so on.

You can try the actual code. Just do the checkout of the code from the repository:

== Project Goals ==

Current:
  * Mapping: commands from Canon PS (Power Shot cams) (OK);
  * Codding: to adapt essential mapped PS commands to main PTP library; (OK)
  * Codding: to wrap necessary camera resources into simple serial calls ( 90% OK);
  * Mapping: necessary registers of the chip Max7456 to work as the OSD core (OK);
  * Testing: sketch which read and write the basic Max7456 registers (OK);
  * Design:  create a basic charset to use on UAV projects (OK);
  * Codding: to insert the charset into the Max7456 prototype;
  * Codding: to wrap all the Map7456 code into a useful library;
  * Codding: to implement OSD pannels for telemetry data on screen;
  * Codding: to write a new SPI class with a parametrized CS method (chip selection);
  * Codding: to merge "USB Host" and "OSD" code using the new SPI class;
  * Codding and Hardware: to use the mini USB host shield;
  * Hardware: to develop an "all-in-one" small board.

Future:
  * Accept newest and smallest Canon PS without PTP from factory:
    * Use CHDK to open one parametrized PTP command to run internal LUA scripts;
  * Accept cams with other brands (when possible to hack their firmware).
