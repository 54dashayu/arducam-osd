This project is based on Arduino. So, you can down to the code, make tweaks, customize or just update the firmware through Arduino IDE.<br> All you need to do is checkout the source from our [http://code.google.com/p/arducam-osd/source/checkout SVN repository].

If you just want to upload you OSD board, the easy way is using released .hex files from our [http://code.google.com/p/arducam-osd/downloads/list Download Section] and use our configuration tool like explained below.

  # Connect your FTDI Serial adapter;
  # Select the proper Serial COM Port (on the example bellow is COM12. Your adapter may use another one);
  # Go to menu *Options* and select *Update Firmware*.
  # Select the desired .hex file from your PC and press *Open*;

If there is a video monitor attached to the OSD, the screen will turn to a blank state.<br>
