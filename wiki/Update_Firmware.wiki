= Updating Firmware =

If you just want to update your OSD board, the easiest way is using released .hex files from our [http://code.google.com/p/arducam-osd/downloads/list Download Section] and use our configuration tool like explained below.

== ArduCAM OSD Config (Update Firmware) ==

  # Connect your FTDI Serial adapter ([https://store.diydrones.com/FTDI_Cable_3_3V_p/ttl-232r-3v3.htm Like this one]);
  # Select the proper Serial COM Port (on the example bellow is COM12. Your adapter may use another one);
  # Go to menu *Options* and select *Update Firmware*.
  # Select the desired .hex file from your PC and press *Open*;

When the process starts, you board will reboot and go to the upload process in few seconds.<br>
If there is a video monitor attached to the OSD, the screen will turn to a blank state.<br>
You have to observe the loading bar on the bottom of ArduCAM OSD Config screen.
