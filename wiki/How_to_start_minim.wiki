#summary How to wire DIYDrone's MinimOSD and attach it to ArduPilot Mega board.

== Basic wiring Diagram ==

This is a basic diagram for using the MinimOSD aboard:

== Using a GSC simultaneously ==

MinimOSD's TX is NOT connected if there is also a "wireless serial link" in parallel (E.g.: XBee) in order to use a Ground Control Station simultaneously.<br>
To use a wireless serial link and MinimOSD at same time, you need to make an "Y" cable or prepare your APM IMU board to have a parallel "mirror" connection.

Bellow is a picture of a nice solution using bent 20mm long male pin-headers.<br>
 * *Upper mirror output:* "TX" from MinimOSD is NOT connected on the APM's telem "OUT".
 * *Lower mirror output:* all the four wires are connected to the wireless serial link.
